**Think of it as:** Giving your AI agent a brain transplant — it inherits the engineering judgment of GPT-5.5, the reasoning of Claude Fable 5, the frontend taste of Claude Design, and the tool orchestration of Gemini CLI.

---

## ⚡ Quick Start

### Step 1: Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/subhansh-dev/agent-maxxing.git
```

### Step 2: Install for your agent

**Claude Code** (user-wide):
```bash
cp -r agent-maxxing ~/.claude/skills/agent-maxxing
```

**Claude Code** (project-scoped):
```bash
cp -r agent-maxxing .claude/skills/agent-maxxing
```

**Codex CLI** (user-wide):
```bash
cp -r agent-maxxing ~/.codex/skills/agent-maxxing
```

**OpenCode** (user-wide):
```bash
cp -r agent-maxxing ~/.opencode/skills/agent-maxxing
```

**Cursor** (project-scoped):
```bash
cp -r agent-maxxing .cursor/skills/agent-maxxing
```

**Continue** (project-scoped):
```bash
cp -r agent-maxxing .continue/skills/agent-maxxing
```

**Kilo Code** (project-scoped):
```bash
cp -r agent-maxxing .kilocode/skills/agent-maxxing
```

### Step 3: Restart your agent

The agent auto-discovers all `.md` files with YAML frontmatter on next session.

### Step 4: Use the skills

Just describe what you want. The agent picks the right skill automatically:

```
"Build a landing page with glassmorphism"
→ Loads frontend-design + glass-card

"Write a blog post that sounds human"
→ Loads humanizer

"Create a diagram of the system architecture"
→ Loads diagram-maker

"Review my code for security issues"
→ Loads security-review
```

### Step 5: Fine-Tune Your Agent

This is where the magic happens. Your agent can **read these skills and transform its own behavior** — not through weight training, but through context injection. When an agent reads a skill file, it internalizes the patterns for that session and applies them to every task.

**What fine-tuning does:**
- Teaches your agent to avoid AI slop (no "Great question!", no purple gradients)
- Injects engineering judgment from GPT-5.5 and Claude Fable 5
- Adds 8-angle code review methodology
- Installs security review patterns
- Forces the execution protocol (solve it, don't ask about it)
- Makes the agent sound human, not like a press release

**How to do it:**

Add this prompt to your agent's system prompt, `CLAUDE.md`, or `AGENTS.md`:

```markdown
## Self-Fine-Tune Protocol

Before responding to any task, read these files in order:
1. FINE-TUNE-AGENT.md — master instructions
2. system-prompts/01-agent-core-personality.md — personality and tone
3. system-prompts/02-coding-excellence.md — engineering patterns
4. system-prompts/03-reasoning-planning.md — thinking patterns
5. engineering/anti-patterns.md — what to avoid
6. engineering/execution-protocol.md — how to operate
7. content/writing-style.md — how to communicate

After reading, apply these patterns to every response.
Check anti-patterns before shipping code.
Follow the 10 Golden Rules.
Sound human, not like a bot.
```

**Or use the master file:** [`FINE-TUNE-AGENT.md`(FINE-TUNE-AGENT/SKILL.md) — comprehensive step-by-step guide that walks your agent through every skill category.

Each skill lives in its own folder as `SKILL.md` — this is the standard naming convention that OpenCode, Claude Code, and other agents use for skill discovery.

**9 folders. 95+ SKILL.md files. Zero dependencies. Just markdown.**

---

## 🔌 Integration Guide

### How Skills Work

Each skill is a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: One-line description
---

# Skill Name

## When to Use
- Trigger condition 1
- Trigger condition 2

## Instructions
1. Step one
2. Step two

## Rules
- Rule 1
- Rule 2
```

When your agent reads this file, it knows:
- **When** to activate this skill (from `description` and "When to Use")
- **What** to do (from "Instructions")
- **What not** to do (from "Rules")

### Permanent Integration (Recommended)

Add this to your agent's system prompt, `CLAUDE.md`, or `AGENTS.md`:

```markdown
## Agent Maxxing Skills

You have access to 95+ skills at `~/.claude/skills/agent-maxxing/` (adjust path for your agent).

When working on any task, check if a relevant skill exists:

### Frontend Work
- frontend-design/01-FRONTEND-DESIGN/SKILL.md — premium UI, glassmorphism, anti-slop
- frontend-design/02-ANIMATE/SKILL.md — motion design, micro-interactions
- frontend-design/04-TYPESET/SKILL.md — typography systems
- frontend-design/artifact-design/SKILL.md — deliberate design choices

### Code Work
- engineering/execution-protocol/SKILL.md — solve it don't ask about it
- engineering/deep-code-review/SKILL.md — 8-angle code review
- engineering/security-review/SKILL.md — security audit
- engineering/debugging-patterns/SKILL.md — systematic debugging

### Writing Work
- content/writing-style/SKILL.md — how to sound human
- content/09-HUMANIZER/SKILL.md — strip AI-isms

### Always Apply
- engineering/anti-patterns/SKILL.md — what to avoid
- engineering/code-review-checklist/SKILL.md — before shipping
- The 10 Golden Rules (see below)
```

### On-Demand Loading

When working on a specific task, the agent should load the relevant skill:

```
User: "Build a dashboard with charts"
Agent: *reads frontend-design/01-FRONTEND-DESIGN/SKILL.md*
Agent: *reads components/data-table/SKILL.md*
Agent: *builds the dashboard following the skill patterns*
```

### Creating Your Own Skills

Follow the template in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md):

1. Create `category/your-skill/SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter
2. Include: name, description, when to use, instructions, rules
3. Test with your agent
4. The agent discovers it automatically on next session

### Skill Discovery

Your agent discovers skills by:
1. Scanning for `SKILL.md` files in the skill directory
2. Reading YAML frontmatter for `name` and `description`
3. Matching task descriptions to skill descriptions
4. Loading the relevant skill before acting

No configuration needed — just drop `SKILL.md` files in the right folder.

## 🏆 The Golden Rules

These patterns come from every top agent in this collection:

1. **Search before answering** — Never guess when you can check
2. **Read the codebase first** — Don't assume, investigate
3. **Parallel tool calls** — Independent ops run simultaneously
4. **Match existing patterns** — Follow the repo's conventions
5. **Show, don't tell** — Demonstrate with examples
6. **Be concise** — Short paragraphs, flat lists, no filler
7. **Take ownership** — Fix mistakes, don't deflect
8. **Respect the user's time** — Don't ask what you can figure out
9. **Ship working code** — Not skeletons, not "you'll need to add..."
10. **Sound human** — Not like a press release or corporate blog

## 💡 P.S. — The Lazy Prompt

Don't want to read through all of that? Pick whichever prompt fits your situation:

### Quick Prompt (just reads and internalizes)

```
Deep dive into the agent-maxxing folder at ~/.claude/skills/agent-maxxing (or wherever you installed it). Read every SKILL.md file — every skill, every system prompt, every component, every workflow example. Understand what each file teaches. Then fine-tune yourself: adopt the patterns, internalize the anti-patterns, apply the engineering judgment, use the writing style. Integrate all 95+ skills so you can use them on any task. From now on, before responding to anything, check if a relevant skill exists and apply it. You are no longer a generic agent — you are maxxed.
```

### Fine-Tune Prompt (behavior transformation — the real magic)

**[Open PROMPT-FINE-TUNE.md on GitHub](https://github.com/subhansh-dev/agent-maxxing/blob/main/PROMPT-FINE-TUNE.md)** — copy the prompt from there.

This is NOT an installation prompt. Use this AFTER the skills are already installed. It forces your agent to internalize the patterns and change how it actually operates on every response. 10 steps: read each core file, confirm you loaded it, demonstrate the behavior change.

### Full Integration Prompt (install + configure + internalize)

**[Open PROMPT-INTEGRATE.md on GitHub](https://github.com/subhansh-dev/agent-maxxing/blob/main/PROMPT-INTEGRATE.md)** — copy the prompt from there.

7 phases: detect platform → locate/clone → install skills → configure permanent integration → self-fine-tune → verify → confirm. Works for Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Cursor, Continue, and Kilo Code.

### Ultra-Short Prompt (for context-limited agents)

```
Read FINE-TUNE-AGENT/SKILL.md in the agent-maxxing skills folder. Follow its self-fine-tune protocol. Internalize anti-patterns, execution protocol, and writing style. From now on, check for relevant skills before every task.
```

That's it. One prompt. Your agent reads everything, learns the patterns, and starts applying them. It won't be perfect (context windows have limits), but it'll be noticeably better.
